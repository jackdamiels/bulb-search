                    "answer": "<p>As we all know, technology changes daily. The number and types of devices using the Internet have increased dramatically in recent years and, as a result, address space for these devices is being rapidly exhausted. Today’s technology for IP addresses is referred to as IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4). The IP addresses aligned with IPv4 are expected to be depleted at some point in the near future. The next generation of IP address space is IPv6, which contains many more features like enhanced security, and a virtually limitless number of addresses. Unfortunately, most servers and other Internet devices will not be speaking IPv6 for a while. IPv4 will remain an entrenched standard for some time to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What is IPv4 depletion?</strong></p>\n<p>Simply put, the industry as a whole (not just Verizon) will at some point run out of IPv4 addresses, which is when IPv6 will come into use.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What does an IPv6 address look like? And how is it different from an IPv4 address?</strong></p>\n<p>A typical IPv6 address will have eight groups of up to four letters and numbers separated by colons, instead of the four groups of three numbers separated by periods found in IPv4 addresses today.</p>\n<p>The following is an example of a valid IPv6 address: 2001:CDBA:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652</p>\n<p>Compared to this IPv4 address example: 24.128.21.12.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>How will you support IPv6 access or content? Can I still use IPv4?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently in the process of upgrading our network to allow for the routing of IPv6 traffic in addition to the current IPv4 traffic, which is referred to as <strong>dual-stack</strong> mode. Customers will continue to have access to the same content and services they currently have. The IPv6 upgrades will allow users to access additional IPv6 content going forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What if I have high-speed internet (DSL)?</strong></p>\n<p>Our DSL network is in the process of being upgraded for dual-stack mode. Many of the same guidelines for our network will apply to DSL when we move to Dual Stack IPv4/IPv6 in regards to availability and customer equipment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What if I have a static IP address?</strong></p>\n<p>Static IP address customers (business customers) will be assigned an IPv6 address in selected locations. We will use an IPv6/56 address format, which means this will support 56 LANs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Where is IPv6 available?</strong></p>\n<p>Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 will be launched in various areas within our network.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Is IPv6 something a customer orders?</strong></p>\n<p>No, IPv6 is a network functionality that we and other companies are implementing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Will I lose my ability to access the internet during the change to IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack?</strong></p>\n<p>No, your ability to access the internet will not change as a result of this network upgrade. All the content that is currently available to you via IPv4 will continue to be available. When the network upgrade is complete and you have an IPv6 capable router, you will be able to view both IPv4 and IPv6 content. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>What will happen if I try to reach an IPv6 website today?</strong></p>\n<p>If you attempt to connect to an IPv6-only website with your service today, you will receive an error message in your browser indicating that a communication error has occurred and you are unable to route to the host. You will receive this message until your area has been changed to dual-stack IPv6/IPv4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Are we out of IPv4 addresses?</strong></p>\n<p>No, we are not out of IPv4 addresses and we will be able to continue to provide IPv4 functionality and static IP (business customers) addresses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Will IPv6 impact DNS assist?</strong></p>\n<p>No, it will continue to work the same way.</p>"

With a home network, your entire household can share one Internet connection with several devices allowing everyone to access the Internet at the same time. You can share access to printers, files, folders, and other hardware devices like gaming systems. There are two types of networks, wired networking and Wi-Fi (wireless networking) between each device. You may have both wired and wireless devices in your home.</p>"

A wired connection provides faster transfer rates and greater security but lacks the flexibility of a wireless connection (Wi-Fi).</p>\n<p>Ethernet cables are classified as “Cat 5”, “Cat 6”, or something similar.

Verizon-provided Wi-Fi routers have a built-in Wi-Fi access point that broadcasts Wi-Fi signals for your Wi-Fi capable devices (Wi-Fi clients) to connect to.</p>\n<p>Your router connects your wireless devices to the Internet using different kinds of radio signals called Wi-Fi Standards. Some devices are compatible with one Wi-Fi standard, others many.

These bands are usually named after the radio frequency they use.</p>\n<p>The 2.4GHz network has been around the longest, making it the most compatible for older devices in the home. It is the best network to handle longer-range connections. Wi-Fi congestion may be a problem if you have many devices broadcasting on this frequency.</p>\n<p>The 5GHz network is newer and supports faster connections if the device is compatible.

This means there are two possible ways you can connect your device to your Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What will I see?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>When setting up your Wi-Fi you may see your Wi-Fi network name appear twice, with one option ending in 2.4GHz and another ending in 5GHz. Only some devices can pick up both frequencies and there are different reasons for picking a particular connection.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Which should I choose?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Generally, Wi-Fi devices operate on 2.4GHz, therefore it can be assumed that other Wi-Fi devices in your home such as baby monitors, cordless phones, and digital TV signal senders may sometimes interfere with your modem's Wi-Fi signal strength. This can be managed by changing some of your Wi-Fi settings, or by moving these devices away from your modem to reduce interference.</li><li>5GHz is a newer way of broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal so you can expect there should be less interference with other Wi-Fi devices should you select this option. However, while you may experience a stronger connection on 5GHz, the frequency wavelength is shorter and you may need to be closer to your modem to pick up a connection. We recommend trying both options to determine which works best in accordance with your home.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>How can I switch between 2.4GHz and 5GHz?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Select the Wi-Fi network name ending in 2.4GHz or 5GHz when connecting to Wi-Fi on your device. Our Wi-Fi set-up tutorial will show you how to manage your Wi-Fi settings on different devices. If you cannot see a 5GHz option this means that you cannot connect to this Wi-Fi frequency on your device.</li></ul>"

                    "answer": "<p>A dual SIM smartphone can support two SIM cards. Whether it’s two physical SIM card slots or eSIM technology, here’s everything you need to know about dual SIM.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a dual SIM?</strong></p>\n<p>Mobile phones require a <strong>SIM card</strong> to connect to a mobile network. Dual SIM is when a mobile phone has the option to use two SIM cards on a single device.</p>\n<p>There are two ways a mobile phone can support dual SIMs:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Dual physical SIMs</strong> - a phone that has two physical SIM card slots</li><li><strong>eSIM</strong> - a phone that has one physical SIM card slot, and one eSIM built into the device</li></ol><p>A mobile phone with dual SIM cards allows the user to standby on two separate mobile networks. This means you’re able to make and receive phone calls and SMS from two different phone numbers, on a single mobile device. You can also use mobile data from the two different networks, however, you may only use the internet on one network at a time.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is the difference between dual SIM and eSIM technology?</strong></p>\n<p>An eSIM is an electronic or embedded SIM card that’s built directly into a mobile phone. A mobile phone with eSIM capabilities also has one physical SIM card slot. This means you’re able to use two different mobile networks; one using the physical SIM slot and one using the eSIM.</p>\n<ul><li>What is the advantage of a dual SIM phone?</li></ul><p>Having the ability to use two different mobile networks on the same mobile device is useful in several situations.</p>\n<ol><li><strong>One phone for work and personal use.</strong> The benefit of using a dual SIM mobile phone is that you’re able to make and receive calls and SMS from both your personal and work phone, all on one device, rather than having to carry around two separate mobile phones.</li><li><strong>International travel.</strong> Dual SIM means you can take advantage of local plans while traveling overseas. You can insert a local SIM into one of the SIM card slots to use for making calls and using data. At the same time, you can keep your Australian SIM in the other card slot, so that you remain available for incoming calls and SMS to your personal number.</li><li><strong>Getting the best deal.</strong> Dual SIM means you can take advantage of the best mobile plans to suit your needs. Because you can only use one of the SIMs for mobile data at a time, you can pick a plan with an appropriate data allowance for this SIM. You can then use the other SIM card slot for calls and text, without having to worry about the amount of data allowance on that plan.</li><li>How can I use mobile data in a dual SIM phone?</li></ol><p>While you can make and receive calls and SMS from either SIM card in dual SIM phones, you can only have one active data connection to the internet. In the Settings section of your phone, you are required to set your preferred SIM for connecting to the Internet.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>How do I know if my phone is dual SIM?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of ways you can check if your phone is dual SIM:</p>\n<ol><li>Open the SIM card settings on your device and see if there are two options</li><li>Check the phone package for two IMEI numbers</li></ol><p></p>\n<p><strong>Can I use one SIM card in a dual SIM phone?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. You can use just one single SIM card in a dual SIM phone. The second SIM card slot simply gives you the option to use a second SIM card if you would like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>How to set up call forwarding in a dual SIM phone</strong></p>\n<p>When a phone is in Dual SIM Dual Standby mode, and one SIM is engaged in a call, you will miss any incoming calls from the other SIM that occur during the time that that first SIM is engaged.<br />\nTo overcome this issue, you can set up call forwarding between the two SIMs. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>How do I activate dual SIM?</strong></p>\n<p>If your phone is single SIM it cannot be converted into a dual SIM phone.<br />\nIf your phone is dual SIM, you can activate it by inserting two SIM cards – one in the first SIM card slot, and a second SIM card in the second SIM card slot. The activation settings for dual SIM can be accessed in your phone’s settings.</p>\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>How do I turn one SIM off on a dual SIM phone?</strong></p>\n<p>You can turn off one SIM card in the settings section of your phone. The settings options may vary between devices. If you do not wish to use a second SIM card, you could also remove the second SIM from the SIM card slot.</p>"

Contact our customer support team and we’ll help get you sorted.</li></ul><p></p>\n<p><strong>Using Mobile Data</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to use data when abroad you may need to activate data roaming when you land (this should be set to “On” even when at home to get optimum coverage). Here’s how to do this :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Android:</strong> Apps <strong>→</strong> Settings <strong>→</strong> Connections <strong>→</strong> Data Usage <strong>→</strong> Enable mobile data</li><li><strong>Apple:</strong> Settings <strong>→</strong> Mobile Data <strong>→</strong> Enable Mobile Data</li></ul><p>In some cases, you may need to manually enter the APN (Access Point Names). The APN is the gateway for the phone to talk to the data part of the mobile network. The majority of phones should automatically choose the correct APN but if they do not you can manually enter the APN which is “Internet”.

                    "answer": "<p><strong>Geography</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A mobile network is made up of cell towers throughout the country. These are tall structures with antennas that broadcast and receive mobile signals. They need to be in locations that are not obscured by buildings, mountains, or forests. The further a customer is away from a cell tower, the lower the data service connection will be. This can mean lower speeds and inconsistent service.</li><li>Service can also be affected in hilly or mountainous areas. A mobile phone signal can get worse as it progresses across hills or mountains, or if the user is in the shadow of a hill with the mast on the far side. This means you may need to move around to improve performance.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Building insulation can affect your services and speeds when using your mobile inside. This applies to both commercial and domestic buildings. There may be indoor areas where you don’t have access to all services or where coverage is limited. You might need to change your location within the building or go outdoors to improve performance.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lots of users</strong></p>\n<ul><li>High usage in your area might cause data speeds to get worse, or make it impossible to send a text or make calls. This could be during morning and evening rush hours, or at events or gigs where thousands of people are nearby. Calls to emergency services are not affected by this.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your device</strong></p>\n<ul><li>We offer services across 2G, 3G, and 4G, but not all devices support all standards. For example, if your mobile phone does not support 4G, you will not be able to achieve 4G speeds. Also, the performance of your service may be affected by having pending software updates on your smartphone or if the storage on the device is full.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Applications used</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Different applications need different speeds from a network to work properly. Sending or receiving emails can be done with lower speeds but uploading or downloading video needs more. The less speed an application needs, the less likely it is to be interrupted by network congestion or poor coverage.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mobile phones can use nearby Wi-Fi instead of the operator’s network. Once registered, users may not realize they’re using Wi-Fi instead of the mobile network. Wi-Fi performance may not be as consistent as that offered by the operator’s network. You can switch from Wi-Fi to your mobile network in your device’s settings.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Call quality</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Your call quality can vary because of the factors above. Sometimes, a call may drop due to moving to, or being somewhere with poor coverage, for example, the basement of a building or a remote forest. Dropped calls can also be caused by issues on the other end of a call.</li></ul>"
